        <h2>How to Choose the Right Pot for Your Plants</h2>
        <p>Choosing the perfect pot can make a world of difference in plant growth. Learn how to select the best one for your plants here:</p>
        <ol class="pot-selection-tips">
            <li><strong>Consider the Size:</strong> Choose a pot that is appropriate for your plant's size. It should allow for growth but not be excessively large.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Drainage:</strong> Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom, which can lead to root rot.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Matters:</strong> Select a pot made of materials that suit your environment. Terracotta is breathable, while plastic is lightweight and retains moisture.</li>
            <li><strong>Style and Aesthetics:</strong> Consider the pot's design and color to ensure it complements your home decor.</li>
            <li><strong>Weight and Mobility:</strong> If you plan to move your plants, opt for lighter pots or those with wheels for easy transportation.</li>
